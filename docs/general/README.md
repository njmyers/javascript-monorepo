# React Size Components

<!-- STORY -->

A very small and lightweight library for measuring your components. Uses the a subscribe/publish method listening to window methods so all of your components subscribe to one event listener. Only one listener for all of you components is great! Also uses PureComponents and no mutations to the sizes prop that gets passed down for improved performance.
