# React YouTube

This is the new hooks based version of the old [react-youtube-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-youtube-component)! I have also changed the package name so that it is namespaced under my organization `@njmyers`. See the updated installation instructions below.

A thin wrapper around the [YouTube IFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference). The goal is to make it easier to use the API in a react centered way. The component uses hooks to downloads the API and create a player instance. The player API is unchanged so you can use the [IFrame API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) directly on your YouTube element to load videos, create playlists and show your content.

## Installation

`npm install @njmyers/react-you-tube`;

or

`yarn add @njmyers/react-you-tube`;
